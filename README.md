"Prompt Genie: Turning Simple Words into Detailed Prompts"

Prompt Genie is designed to transform basic user inputs into sophisticated prompts tailored specifically for image generation, bridging the gap between user intentions and the technical demands of generative AI.
The project involves fine-tuning LLMs to excel at the task of prompt generation. By training the models on a range of basic to advanced prompt generation tasks, we aim to create a system that can produce high-quality, contextually accurate prompts from simple user inputs. This fine-tuning process enhances the LLMâ€™s ability to understand and elaborate on user needs, ensuring more effective and precise prompt generation.
